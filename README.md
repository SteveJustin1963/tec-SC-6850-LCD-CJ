Hi Stephen, I just want to give you a head's up, I am working on an add-on board for the SC which will have a 6850 and a connection for a variety of LCD's. I have had Firth Forth and Grant Searle's basic running on my breadboard version and I will be starting the board design shortly, but if you don't want or don't want to wait for the board I could send you the circuit so you could build it on veroboard. I am still to finalize the LCD part of the circuit, I am trying to cover as many possible Character and Graphic types.

Thank you Craig for the heads up appreciate it. Anything you send to me would be a bonus thank you so much. I will always look to you and John and the rest of the team as being the leaders in this area. My own skills are nowhere near your own and the others but I’m on a journey of learning like the others and would be willing to try anything. I personally been very keen to get forth running on anything tec related It frustrates me for my lack of skills to get there faster. Your skills and John skills and a couple other partners in the group are very adept at getting things done fast. I wish I could be mentored by somebody who is a leader in all this but as always it’s better to go at once pace  and really thoroughly go through the textbooks first before burning the experts as they say. Once again thank you.
